## What is this project?
This a command line application that allows you to search for books and construct a reading list. It is written using python version 3.6 or newer.

## How does it work?
* Open a terminal window and clone the repository

* `cd` into the directory and run the application by typing `./reading_list.py`

* You should see a welcome prompt with instructions

Hooray! 🎉🎉🎉

Your list will be saved locally to a file called `reading_list.json`.
Even if you exit the application your reading list will be available to you when you come back.

🐞 Feel free to report any bugs you find.

📖 Enjoy your books! 📖
